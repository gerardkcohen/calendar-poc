# Accessible Calendar POC

A different way of providing an accessible calendar/ datepicker widget. From the 2018 (24a11y.com)[https://www.24a11y.com/] article (A New Day: Making a Better Calendar)[https://www.24a11y.com/2018/a-new-day-making-a-better-calendar/].

Important parts are the markup, language, and announcements used. JS is secondary and really just supports the HTML.

If you have any questions or need help, reach out on twitter (@gerardkcohen)[https://twitter.com/gerardkcohen]. If you used this for anything, let me know. It would make me really happy to know that I was able to help someone.
